# comp1511-streaming-config
This repo contains all information and resources to set up and operate a COMP1511 livestream. 

# Prerequisites
- The laptop you are using should be unmanaged (or you'll need a firm guarantee of no interruptions) and have OBS installed with full permissions unlocked
- If you are using a smartphone as a camera (at time of writing we're using an iphone 15 PM), you should make sure the phone has the paid version of OBS camera installed
  - the laptop will also need to have the OBS camera plugin installed and any requested permissions granted
- If using an hdmi camera:
  - ensure camera outputs a clean hdmi feed (no viewfinder markings)
  - ensure you have a working capture card
- Ensure you have ethernet connection between the laptop running OBS and the LDS port in the theatre
